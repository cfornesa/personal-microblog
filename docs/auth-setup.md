# Auth Setup

## Local Development

Use two terminals:

```bash
npm run dev:api
npm run dev:web
```

The expected local origins are:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`

The frontend dev server proxies both `/api/*` and `/auth/*` to the backend, so browser-based auth and API calls stay on the frontend origin during development.

## Required `.env` Values

```env
PORT=8080
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
API_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:20925,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080
AUTH_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_secret
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
GITHUB_ID=your_github_oauth_app_client_id
GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_oauth_app_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASS=your_database_password
```

Generate a real auth secret with something like:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Database Setup

- The app expects MySQL connection settings through `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS`.
- A single canonical MySQL database can be shared by both the deployed app and a local publishing workflow.
- Existing SQLite content can be imported before cutover using the optional `SQLITE_IMPORT_PATH`.

## OAuth Callback URLs

Configure these callback URLs in your provider dashboards:

- GitHub: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/github`
- Google: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/google`

If you deploy under a different origin later, replace `http://localhost:3000` with that public origin.

## First Owner Bootstrap

1. Start the backend and frontend.
2. Sign in once with the account you want to own the site.
3. List local users:

```bash
npm run list-users --workspace=@workspace/scripts
```

4. Promote your account:

```bash
npm run promote-owner --workspace=@workspace/scripts -- --email you@example.com
```

You can also promote by user ID:

```bash
npm run promote-owner --workspace=@workspace/scripts -- --id your-user-id
```

## Expected Behavior After Setup

- Signed-in members can comment.
- Signed-in members can edit their own comments after posting.
- The promoted owner can create, edit, and delete posts.
- Owner post composition uses the rich editor with sanitized HTML storage, local image uploads, and approved iframe embeds.
- The owner can also moderate comments.

## Public Feed Endpoints

Once the backend and frontend are running, these public feed/export routes should respond without authentication:

- Atom: `http://localhost:3000/feed.xml`
- JSON Feed: `http://localhost:3000/feed.json`
- mf2-JSON export: `http://localhost:3000/export/json`
- Compatibility alias: `http://localhost:3000/export.json`
