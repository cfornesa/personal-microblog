## Project Profile

<!-- Operational details for this project. Kept here, not in AGENTS.md,
     to keep the root instruction file framework-agnostic and safe to
     publish. Do not put credentials, hostnames, file paths, or API
     keys here — those belong in .env.

     An agent fills this section during Phase 1 by asking the person
     plain-language questions. If this section is empty, ask before
     writing any code. See AGENTS.md → Detect the Framework. -->

- **Stack:** npm workspaces monorepo; TypeScript throughout; Express 5 API; React 19 + Vite frontend.
- **Deployment:** Node.js application, single-process API server with separate Vite-built frontend artifact.
- **Database:** MySQL via Drizzle ORM.
- **Version pins:** Node 24 direction in repo docs; npm 11.12.1; TypeScript ~5.9.2.
- **Framework AGENTS.md:** No framework-specific AGENTS file is present. Sessions follow root `AGENTS.md`.
- **Profile switch rule:** Stop before touching existing files. Record
  current state and reason here. Confirm new profile explicitly. Flag
  every file needing migration before starting.

## REVIEW REQUIRED — Read before starting next session
<!-- Agent writes this block. Human must confirm or override each item before new code is written. -->
- [x] 2026-04-28 Direction-first docs chosen over a pure implementation snapshot so future sessions optimize for the intended product, not just the current stack.
- [x] 2026-04-28 Authentication direction selected for planning: migrate from Clerk toward Auth.js with GitHub + Google as the initial OAuth providers.
- [x] 2026-04-28 Public interaction model is confirmed at a high level: visitors may log in, comment, and react; only the site owner may publish canonical posts.
- [x] 2026-04-28 Initial owner bootstrap policy selected: manual database promotion after the owner's first Auth.js-backed login.

## 2026-04-29 — Canonical MySQL Datastore

### Decisions Confirmed
- MySQL is now the canonical datastore for both deployed publishing and local authoring workflows.
- SQLite is no longer the intended long-term runtime datastore for the app; it is now legacy import material only.
- The app now uses one shared database model across local and deployed runtimes so edits made locally can be reflected in the deployed site.
- The Hostinger build-coupled SQLite workflow is considered superseded because it allowed deployed content to be replaced by build-scoped database state.
- The runtime connection contract now centers on `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS`.
- Auth.js persistence, posts, comments, reactions, and feed-backed content reads are now intended to live in the same MySQL database.
- Owner-authored rich posts may now include iframe embeds from any `https:` source, with the owner acting as the trust boundary for embedded content.

### Implementation Notes
- The shared Drizzle runtime was migrated from `libsql`/SQLite wiring to a MySQL-backed connection layer.
- The database schema definitions were rewritten from SQLite-specific table primitives to MySQL-compatible ones.
- Backend create/update flows that previously relied on `.returning()` were adjusted for MySQL-compatible insert/update behavior.
- A one-time import script now exists to copy legacy SQLite content into the canonical MySQL datastore.

### Operational Outcome
- Local publishing is no longer conceptually separate from deployed publishing; both are expected to act on the same canonical content store when pointed at the same MySQL database.
- Future sessions should reason about content continuity, auth persistence, and deployment safety through MySQL rather than through local SQLite files.

### Unresolved Checkpoints Entering Next Session
- [ ] Verify the final Hostinger production environment variables point at the intended canonical MySQL database rather than any legacy SQLite-backed runtime.
- [ ] Decide whether the legacy SQLite file and related import scaffolding should remain in-repo for recovery purposes or be removed after production verification.

## 2026-04-29 — Authoring, Feeds, And Runtime Recovery

### Decisions Confirmed
- The site now supports two post content modes: legacy plain-text posts and rich posts stored as sanitized HTML with a `content_format` field.
- Rich post creation and editing are owner-only and use a toolbar-backed editor rather than a plain textarea.
- Rich post HTML is sanitized on the server before persistence; stored rich content is rendered as HTML on the frontend after that server-side sanitization step.
- Rich posts support local image uploads and owner-trusted `https:` iframe embeds rather than arbitrary unsanitized HTML.
- Comments remain plain text, but authenticated users can now edit their own comments inline after posting.
- The homepage composer is now collapsed by default and expands only when the owner explicitly chooses to start a post.
- The homepage feed now supports client-side browsing controls for sort and filter operations instead of remaining a fixed reverse-chronological list.
- Standardized public feeds are now part of the app surface: `/feed.xml` serves Atom, `/feed.json` serves JSON Feed 1.1, and `/export/json` serves mf2-JSON export.
- `GET /export.json` was retained as a compatibility alias so the repo's export URL guarantee remains intact while also honoring the newly approved `/export/json` route.
- Feed item URLs continue to use the current canonical post route shape of `/posts/:id`; no slug migration was introduced in this session.
- Feed summaries are generated from the first 50 visible characters of post content and append `...` only when truncation occurs.
- Feed autodiscovery is now exposed from the frontend document head through `<link rel="alternate">` tags for Atom and JSON Feed.

### Implementation Notes
- Auth.js on Express 5 now mounts at `/auth` rather than a wildcard route because the earlier wildcard pattern conflicted with Express 5 routing behavior and Auth.js action parsing.
- The backend now exposes comment-update behavior alongside the existing comment create/delete flow.
- Rich-post persistence required API contract changes, schema evolution for posts, and frontend rendering that distinguishes plain text from sanitized HTML.
- Local media uploads are handled by the app server itself, with validation and rate-limiting support added alongside the upload route.
- The frontend rich editor is shared across create and edit flows so the authoring controls remain consistent.

### Runtime Recovery
- The originally approved server sanitizer stack of `DOMPurify + jsdom` proved non-functional in the repo's bundled API runtime because `jsdom` attempted to read files that were not present in the bundled deployment shape.
- In accordance with the root AGENTS rule for non-functional specified tech, implementation stopped, alternatives were surfaced, and the replacement path required explicit sign-off before proceeding.
- The backend sanitizer was then replaced with `sanitize-html`, restoring a bootable API while preserving the sanitized-HTML storage model already approved for rich posts.
- Restarting the backend after that recovery applied the pending posts migration, including the `content_format` column needed for rich post saves to work correctly.

### Resulting Product Shape
- The site now behaves as a single-author publishing space where the owner can compose rich posts with formatting, uploads, and owner-trusted embeds, while signed-in visitors can comment and edit their own comments.
- Visitors can browse posts with sort and filter controls and can consume the site's content through standardized feed and export endpoints without authentication.

### Unresolved Checkpoints Entering Next Session
- [ ] Decide whether post canonicals should remain `/posts/:id` long-term or later migrate to a slugged archive structure without breaking existing feed/export URLs.
- [ ] Decide whether comments should remain plain-text-only long-term or later gain lightweight formatting support.
- [ ] Decide whether local media uploads remain the long-term storage plan or whether they should later move to managed object storage for deployment portability.

## 2026-04-29 — Session Record Recovery

### Decisions Confirmed
- `MEMORY.md` was effectively empty even though `DECISIONS.md`, `CONSTRAINTS.md`, project docs, and the working tree showed substantial prior progress.
- The recovery approach for this session is evidence-only backfill rather than speculative reconstruction.

### Recovery Sources Used
- Existing project records in `DECISIONS.md`, `CONSTRAINTS.md`, and `DESIGN.md`.
- Current setup docs including `docs/auth-setup.md` and `env.example`.
- Current repo metadata including `package.json`, the working tree, and recent git commit history.

### Guardrails
- No new product, auth, or architecture decisions were introduced as part of this recovery pass.
- Any future historical gaps should be recorded explicitly as unknown rather than inferred.

## 2026-04-28 — Direction Setting Session

<!-- Created by the agent at session start.
     Record every significant decision made during this phase.
     Use bullet points. One fact per bullet.
     Flag gaps or deferred items as noted below. -->

### Stack Confirmed
- Workspace uses npm workspaces with TypeScript across packages.
- API server is Express 5.
- Frontend is React 19 with Vite.
- Persistence is MySQL through Drizzle ORM.
- Current auth implementation is Clerk for web sessions.

### Product Direction Confirmed
- The site is evolving toward a personalized social platform centered on engagement with the author's ideas.
- Publishing is owner-controlled: canonical posts originate from the site owner only.
- Visitor participation is interaction-focused rather than publishing-focused: authenticated visitors should be able to comment and react.
- Identity direction should favor open, portable, low-cost approaches over centralized providers when feasible.

### Design References Confirmed
- `bluesky.net` is the primary interface/style reference.
- `fornesus.blog` is the primary background/atmosphere reference.

### Structural Implications Identified
- Auth must be decoupled from publishing authority. Logging in and posting can no longer be treated as the same permission boundary.
- The data model will likely need explicit user roles or capabilities so the owner retains publish rights while other authenticated users receive interaction-only permissions.
- The current comment system can stay conceptually, but it should be refit around durable visitor identities rather than a single-provider assumption.
- Reactions do not appear to exist as a first-class feature yet and will likely require a dedicated persistence model and API surface.
- If open identity is pursued, account linkage will likely need a more flexible identity model than a single provider user ID.
- Moderation and trust boundaries become first-order concerns once public sign-in is enabled for commenting and reactions.

### Irreversible Decisions Deferred
- Auth migration direction and initial provider set are selected, but exact endpoint structure and owner bootstrap mechanics are still deferred.
- No `rel=me`, IndieAuth, Micropub, or syndication target decisions have been made yet.
- No public URL restructuring has been authorized.

### Environment Variables Required
- `PORT`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `DATABASE_PATH` (optional in current implementation)
- `LOG_LEVEL` (optional in current implementation)

### Gaps and Deferred Items
- Add or revise the dependencies document if the provider set or auth architecture changes later.
- Decide later whether manual owner promotion should remain the long-term policy or be replaced with a repeatable seed command.
- Implement the initial local role model as `owner` plus `member`, leaving any moderator tier out of scope for now.

### Unresolved Checkpoints Entering Next Session
- [x] Choose and sign off on the target authentication architecture before schema or route migrations.
- [ ] Define the owner/admin capability model versus public authenticated user capabilities.
- [x] Decide whether reactions are part of the first interaction release or a follow-on phase.

## 2026-04-28 — Auth Direction Lock For PR 1

### Decisions Confirmed
- Auth migration target is Auth.js running in the existing Express server.
- Initial OAuth provider set is GitHub plus Google.
- Public profile URL strategy for the migration is `/users/:userId`.
- Reaction scope for v1 is `like` only.
- Account linking will have no self-serve linking UI in v1.
- Initial owner bootstrap policy is manual database promotion after the owner's first successful login.
- The initial capability model is `owner` plus `member`, with no separate moderator role in the first migration.
- Current Clerk-based auth remains the active implementation until later migration PRs replace it.

### Implications Accepted
- Provider account IDs will not become public canonical profile identifiers.
- Authorization must remain local to the app even when authentication is delegated to GitHub or Google.
- A later migration phase must translate existing author references away from Clerk-shaped IDs.

### Remaining Open Question
- Decide later whether the manual bootstrap should remain permanent or be replaced by a seed command once the auth migration is stable.

## 2026-04-28 — PR 3 Backend Auth Cutover

### Decisions Confirmed
- Clerk middleware has been removed from the Express API server.
- Auth.js is now the backend authentication substrate and is mounted at `/auth/*`.
- The server now resolves authenticated users from local Auth.js sessions and the local `users` table.
- Post creation and post deletion are owner-only on the server.
- Comment creation is available to authenticated active users, and comment deletion is allowed to the comment author or the owner.

### Accepted Temporary Mismatch
- The backend has been cut over before the frontend auth UI has been migrated off Clerk.
- During this interim state, frontend sign-in flows still need a later PR to use Auth.js instead of Clerk.

### Follow-on Work
- Replace Clerk-based frontend sign-in and session UI with Auth.js-aware frontend flows.
- Update OpenAPI contracts and generated clients once the final auth-facing route behavior is stabilized.

---

## 2026-04-28 — Frontend Auth.js Swap

### Decisions Confirmed
- The web app now uses a single `/sign-in` screen with GitHub and Google OAuth entry points.
- `/sign-up` is retained only as a redirect alias to `/sign-in`.
- Frontend current-user state is now derived from the local `/api/users/me` endpoint and Auth.js-backed cookies.
- Clerk has been removed from the frontend runtime and package dependencies.

### Implementation Notes
- Auth-related frontend requests now rely on cookie-based session transport instead of Clerk client state.
- The compose UI renders from the local role model: only the owner sees post composition, while authenticated users can comment.
- Existing profile routes continue to use `/users/:userId` even though the underlying API contract still has legacy naming that should be cleaned up later.

---

## 2026-04-28 — Identity Contract Cleanup

### Decisions Confirmed
- The OpenAPI and generated client contract now use `userId` instead of `clerkId`.
- The user-posts API route is now documented and implemented as `/posts/user/{userId}`.
- Generated API client and Zod schema packages have been regenerated from the renamed contract so frontend and backend identity terminology now match.

---

## 2026-04-28 — Local Auth Usability Pass

### Decisions Confirmed
- Local development now uses separate frontend and backend ports with the frontend proxying `/api/*` and `/auth/*` to the backend.
- The expected local dev origins are `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:8080` for the backend.
- Owner bootstrap remains operator-run, but the repo now includes scripts to list local users and promote one to `owner` after first sign-in.

### Setup Artifacts Added
- `docs/auth-setup.md` documents `.env`, OAuth callback URLs, local dev commands, and owner promotion.
- The example env files now document `FRONTEND_PORT` and `API_ORIGIN` in addition to the Auth.js provider variables.

---

### 2026-05-02 — Post Expansion and Embed Capabilities

### Decisions Confirmed
- Posts now support an "Expand" action in the feed view, which navigates directly to the post's dedicated detail page.
- "Expand" is represented by a `Maximize` icon and appears on hover for all posts in the feed.
- The site now supports a standalone, frameless embed view for individual posts at `/embed/posts/:id`.
- The embed view renders only the post content, author attribution, and a "View on Microblog" link, without the standard site navigation or layout framing.
- An "Embed" action (represented by a `Code` icon) is now available on hover for all posts.
- Clicking the "Embed" button copies a pre-configured `<iframe>` code snippet to the user's clipboard for easy syndication.

### Implementation Notes
- `App.tsx` layout was refactored to conditionally render the `Navbar` and site shell based on whether the current route is an embed path.
- A new `PostEmbed` page component was created to handle the frameless rendering logic.
- `PostCard` was updated with hover actions for "Maximize" and "Code" buttons, using the existing styling pattern established for owner-only actions (Edit/Delete).
- The embed logic uses `navigator.clipboard` to provide a seamless copy-paste experience for the iframe snippet.

### Unresolved Checkpoints Entering Next Session
- [ ] Monitor if the `iframe` default height (400px) in the copied snippet is sufficient for most rich posts or if it should be more dynamic.
- [ ] Decide if the embed view should support any interactive elements like reactions or if it should remain a static content view.
